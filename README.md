This is a project for a Game Design class at NYU for Spring 2019

>On a quiet evening in the wizard museum, you accidentally touched an evil artifact, which caused all of the exhibits to come alive. Now, you must get to the wizardsâ€™ management office so they can fix everything, but can you overcome the many fake dangers in front of you?

>A stealth-based game where you explore a procedurally-generated enchanted museum in a world filled with wizards.
